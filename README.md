# Bingo Team Indicators
Do you struggle remembering who is on your Bingo team during Clan Events?
Have you accidentally cheered for an opposing team member getting a drop, thinking they're on your team?

No more!

The Bingo Team Indicators plugin adds an icon to people's name in the chatbox, so you always know if they're on your team or not!



# How it works
-> Simply fill in the desired amount of teams (between 1 and 15) in the Sidepanel.  
-> Fill in the in-game names of the participants in the textfields, separated by commas.  
-> The plugin will now add an icon before the names of the participants based on which team they're in Clan chat, Guest Clan chat, and Friends chat!
